# OpenVBconf for Dart
This repository contains a Dart implementation of the OpenVBconf standard, developed by ExpressiveLabs.

### Warning
This package currently only supports OpenVB configurations in JSON format. For binary format OpenVB files, please use the [`openvb-rs`](https://github.com/ExpressiveLabs/openvb-rs) crate.

## Installation
This package is not on pub.dev (yet). To use it, add the following to your `pubspec.yaml`:
```yaml
dependencies:
  # ...
  openvb:
    git:
      url: https://github.com/ExpressiveLabs/openvb-dart.git

## How to use
<!-- This package relies on native assets. Compile with the `--enable-experiment=native-assets` flag:
